# Tic-tac-toe Game
A [Tic-tac-toe Game](https://tzunwip.github.io/tictactoe-game/), written in plain javascript, created following [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) [javascript lesson](https://theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

The aim of this project was to make use of immediately invoked function expression module design patterns to avoid polluting the global namespace and present code in a more organised manner. The AI opponent was initially created based on the Minimax algorithm. It was later improved using the faster Alpha-beta pruning algorithm which decreases the number of nodes evaluated compared to the Minimax algorithm. Players can choose which algorithm to play against to see the difference in speed.

## Features
