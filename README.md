# Tic-tac-toe Game
A [Tic-tac-toe Game](https://tzunwip.github.io/tictactoe-game/), written in plain javascript, created following [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/) [javascript lesson](https://theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/tic-tac-toe-javascript).

The aim was to make use of Module patterns and avoid polluting the global namespace. An AI opponent was created using the Minimax algorithm. An improved AI was also added, using the faster Alpha-beta pruning algorithm which decreases number of nodes evaluated compared to the Minimax algorithm. Players can choose which algorithm to play against to see the difference in speed.
